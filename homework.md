*Hi Everyone**

This is all very new to me, randomly whenever I need to add an image I always use my favourite pokemon. Yes I know I was born in the 80's. Yes I know some of my friends have children in their early late teens. I don't care I admit to having a favourite pokemon. Anyay back to work :-)

There are quite a few things about this module that I have found frustrating. There are quite a few new terms that have been used and it has been difficult to get my head around.

For instance the first task is to add "a new markdown file in this repository". I was under the impression that markdown was a way of editing text files in Github so I can only assume and hope that the task was to add a text file and make it look more visually appealing using formatting syntax

I just hope that this is correct. So far I have found this very interesting but I will have to watch a few youtube videos to fully grasp how to use this.
